# HealthMate
This is a basic healthcare app which is developed by using XML and JAVA on Android Studio. For database, SQlite is used.
This App allows for features like:
1) Booking Lab Tests
2) Booking Appointments 
3) Buying Medicines
4) Health ChatBot using OpenAI API
And Other Features!


To start with the app, you can register and log in.
Upon logging in, you will be directed to the home page; a hamburger menu button on the top left leads you to an introductory page where there is a chat button on the bottom if you wish to use chatbot using OPENAI's ChatGPT.
On the home page itself, you have options to all the features offered by the app. It is a streamlined app to use, and everything added to the cart can be viewed in the cart option available on the home page itself.
